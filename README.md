# PHASE-PREDICTION_OF_HIGH_ENTROPY_ALLOYS
This repository contains code, data, and documentation for predicting the phases of high entropy alloys (HEAs) using various machine learning techniques. High entropy alloys are a new class of materials that are characterized by their multi-principal element compositions, leading to unique structural and functional properties
